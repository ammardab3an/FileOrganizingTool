# FileOrganizingTool
a tool you can use to organize your torrent episodes files

when you download your favorate show episodes from the torrent (for example game of thrones)
after a while you will have soo many files like i do
so i had that idea to make a tool to help me to organize them and put each file in a different folder like "Game Of Thrones S05E04"
and that is what i did

to use it write your show name (for example "13 Reasons Why") in the text box (Folder Name),
then enable the switch (torrent file mode) and chose your season number next to it,
then you will see the next folder name in the textbox under the (foldername textbox) changing,
if you want to change the episode number you can change the main Numeric,
then Drag-drop your (file/files/folder/folders/files and folders) on the form.

you will notice that the number of episode will automatically change for the next folder

***the auto mode***
the auto mode is the best way to organize your series videos that have a number like (S01E01)

all you have to do is to type your show name in the textbox and Drag-drop all your files to the form,the program will auto create folders for each season and folders for each episode

ps: this tool can help you in many situations not only torrent files

hope you will enjoyed it
